            <p><strong>Python</strong> is a widely used high-level programming language used for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
            <p><strong>Django</strong> is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.</p>
            <p>Ridiculously fast:
                Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>Reassuringly secure:
                Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.</p>
            <p>Exceedingly scalable:
                Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.</p>
