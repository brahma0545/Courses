            <h1>Course details</h1>
            <p>In this course, we started from the basics of algorithms and made the concepts very simple so that anyone with minimum or no prior knowledge also can understand, learn and master easily. This course covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in the field of computer science. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but also you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in C Programming Language.</p>
            <p>This course will help you to crack the interviews of the product based companies. Understanding the power and limitations of algorithms helps to solve the real life problems smarter and faster.</p>
            <p>In this course, we will explain all the possible ways to solve the problem and analyse each solution using Time & Space Complexity. After finishing this course, you will be able to solve any problem with an optimal solution.</p>
